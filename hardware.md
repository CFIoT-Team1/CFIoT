# üîß Hardware Overview

This enclosure houses the core components for measuring and transmitting energy data. The setup is securely mounted on a cabinet and designed for stable, long-term monitoring.

## üîç Functional Overview

This energy monitoring system is built around a DIN-rail-mounted power meter that measures electrical parameters such as voltage, current, and power. It transmits this data wirelessly to a cloud platform via Wi-Fi. The system is fully enclosed for safety and reliability.

### System Responsibilities and Hardware Mapping

- **Integrated Measurement and Processing Unit**  
  ‚Üí **Component: Adtek CPM-12D**  
  Measures electrical values directly from the circuit, processes the data internally, and displays real-time values on its screen. Communicates over RS485.

- **Communication Module**  
  ‚Üí **Component: ZQWL-GE300D RS485-to-Wi-Fi dongle**  
  Sends processed data wirelessly to the cloud using the Modbus RTU protocol over RS485.

- **Power Supply**  
  ‚Üí **Component: DIN Rail Power Supply** *(model unspecified)*  
  Delivers regulated DC voltage to all components. Powered directly from the measured circuit.

- **Relay Control**  
  ‚Üí **Component: RT10-32X Relay**  
  Used to control a connected load or simulate switching behavior. Can be triggered automatically based on measurement conditions or manually.
