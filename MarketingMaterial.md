## Core Value and Differentiation
Breaking free from the limitations of traditional metering and the expense of high-end systems, our solution offers an essential energy management system designed to empower users without breaking the bank.

Key strenghts compared to competitors:
- **Low Cost and Cost-Effectiveness**: the system is designed to be more affordable than industrial energy management systems and, through the promotion of behavioral change, offers immediate and tangible return on a very moderate investment;
- **Simplicity and Clarity**: user application designed for clear data visualization as well as easy installation set it apart from unnecessarily complicated solutions;
- **Scalable IoT Platform**: besides its value as a standalone tool, the integration with a fog layer serves as a foundation for integrating future features that can be shared with multiple meters;
- **Secure Cloud Data Storage and Remote Accessibility**: unlike basic local data loggers, our system stores data in the cloud, which can be accessed anytime, anywhere, with the user application;
- **Integrated Power Supply**: operating power directly drawn from the line, which simplifies installation and reduces costs of an additional power source;
- **Dedicated User App**: data visualization provides a clear way to interpret information, which cannot be found in meters with simple displays or raw data outputs;

## Audience Profile
The primary target market are those who can benefit the most from accessible, cost-effective energy monitoring to gain insight and reduce costs. These include:
- **Households**: solve the issue of infrequent electricity bills and reduce monthly expenses without needing to buy expensive smart home systems or appliance upgrades;
- **Small-Medium Enterprises**: motivated by operation cost reduction and efficiency, our solution can provide both with a very small investment;
- **Rental Properties**: can offer energy monitoring to the tenants, encouraging responsible energy use, as well as monitor consumption in common areas;
- **Educational Institutions**: meter can be used as a practical teaching tool, allowing students to see the impact of conservation efforts, as well as monitoring specific equipment (e.g. labs)
- **Workshops**: small manufacturing operations that have a very significant energy consumption from specific equipment but lack insight into its usage patterns;
- **Community Centers and NGOs**: facilities that often operate on a budged can identify energy waste and reduce operating costs, freeing up resources for their core mission;

## Promotion Stategy
The promotion strategy will focus on educating potential users about the **information gap** and positioning our smart meter as a simple, affordable, ad effective solution to gain control over energy costs and consumption:
- **Education on the "Invisible Bill"**:
  - Launch a campaing highlighting the frustration and lost potential savings associated with not knowing your real-time energy use;
  - Use relatable scenarios to engage with the public. Examples include:
    - _Peak-Hour Blindness_: you run your washing machine at peak hours, knowing you're losing money, but do you know exactly how much you're losing?
    - _Vacation Surprise_: you went away for the weekend and unplugged everything but the bill is surprisingly high. Who is the culprit? There's no way to know with traditional bills!
    - _The Cost of Days Off_: are weekends more expensive than weekdays? Sure, the TV and the lights will be on for more time, but are these small habits adding up significantly? We need daily monitoring to know that!
- **Showace Tangible Savings**:
  - Provide clear examples on how adjusting habits based on data insights can lower electricity bills;
  - Use simple calculations to demonstrate the potential return on investment;
- **Position as an Accessible First Step**: Market the product as the ideal starting point for anyone serious about saving energy an money;
- **Leverage Digital Platforms**:
  - Use social media and create engaging content such as graphics or short explanatory videos;
  - Run targeted ads based on demographics and interests in smart homes, environmental awareness and money saving;
- **Community Engagement**: explore partnerships with local community centers, homeowner associations or business guilds to host workshops and provide hands-on experience to potential users;
