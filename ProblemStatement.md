## The Context: Global Challenges, Local Urgency, and Current Inspiration
The escalating climate crisis and **global energy challenges** demand immediate and innovative solutions. Countries worldwide are pursuing energy transitions, emphasizing renewable sources and, critically, **improvements in energy efficiency**. 

Within this global picture, **Taiwan** faces unique and pressing energy concerns. With a heavy reliance on imported fossil fuels (approximately 90% of energy supply), ambitious goals for Net-Zero emissions by 2050 alongside a nuclear phase-out, enhancing energy security and optimizing domestic energy consumption are paramount national priorities. 

Insipration for leveraring technology in this area was further drawn from the recent **2025 Smart City Summit & Expo** held in Taipei, which featured solutions for the digital and green transition towards Net Zero Cities, underlining the urgency of exploring accessible tools for **energy management**. Furthermore, Taiwan's power grid operates under significant strain, with tight reserve margins and vulnerability to peak load demands, highlighting the urgent need for effective energy management strategies at all levels

## The Problem: The Barrier of Invisibility and Inaction
A significant barrier to energy conservation is often the **lack of clear, timely information**. Many individuals and small businesses struggle to understand their own energy consumption patterns because traditional utility bills provide only **delayed, aggregated data**. 

This **"Information Gap"** hinders the ability to identify waste, understand the impact of specific behaviors, or make informed decisions about usage. While advanced energy efficiency upgrades can be effective, they often represent significant **cost barriers**. Therefore, empowering users with direct insigts into their energy use provides a **fundamental, accessible pathway** towards conservation, enabling both environmental benefits and potential cost savings through behavioral adjustments. Compounding this, many individuals and small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) face substantial cost barriers to implementing energy efficiency upgrades through new appliances or infrastructure improvements. 

In these common scenarios, optimizing _how energy is used_ rather than just _what_ technology is used, becomes the most accessible and impactful approach to achieving both environmental benegits and crucial cost savings. Many users simply lack the **granular, real-time information** and effective motivation needed to understand and modify their energy consumption patterns effectively

## The Proposed Solution: An Accessible IoT Energy Monitoring System
The project proposes the development and prototypicng of an IoT-based **smart power meter** focused on **lowering the barrier to energy information access**. 

The core principle is to make **real-time** and **historical** energy consumption data readily available to users, therefore fostering awareness and enabling informed decision making.

The system will consist of:
- **Power Sensor**: to accurately collect electricity usage data;
- **Cloud Data Storage**: to securely sotre the collected energy data;
- **User Application**: to visualize both real-time power consumption and historical usage trends, accessible anytime and anywhere;

The system provides the essential foundations of **real-time eco-feedback**, addressing the critical information gap.

By delivering clear, actionable data, it empowers users with the awareness necessary to understand their energy footprint and begin making informed changes.

### Possible future expansions
Building upon this core functionality, future iterations and further research could explore serval promising avenues:
- **Advanced Persuasive Techniques**: integrating more sophisticated features inspired by **Design for Sustainable Behavior (DfSB)** research, such as tailored recommendations, social comparison modules (allowing anonymous comparison with peers), or gamification elements (goal-setting, rewards) to further motivate and sustain energy-saving behaviors.
- **Contextual Data Integration**: incorporating data streams from environmental sensors (e.g. temperature, humidity, ambient light) or publicly available data to provide users with richer context about how external conditions influence their energy needs and usage.
- **Predictive Analytics**: developing algorithms that leverage historical dataa and potentially external factors (like weather forecasts) to predict future energy consumption, helping users anticipate high-usage periods or otpimize device scheduling;
- **Device-Specific Monitoring**: Expanding the system to monitor energy consumption at the individual appliance level, offering more granural insights for targeted savings
